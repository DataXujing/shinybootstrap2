This is a resubmission of shinybootstrap2 0.2 with updated license information.

All copyright holders listed in the sources are listed as "cph" in Authors@R. Where the copyright holders are natural persons, they are also listed as "ctb". Where the copyright holders are not natural persons, I have taken the following approach:

* Bootstrap: The copyright holder is Twitter, Inc. I have listed "Twitter, Inc", as "cph", and "Bootstrap contributors" as "ctb". The Bootstrap project page also names two creators of the project, and so I have listed them as "ctb". (According to Bootstrap's commit history, there are hundreds of others who have contributed to Bootstrap, so I have not listed them each individually.)
* DataTables: The copyright holder is "SpryMedia Limited". Because no natural person is listed in the documentation for DataTables, I have "SpryMedia Limited" as "ctb" and "cph".
