Description: Provides Bootstrap 2 web components for use with the Shiny
    package. With versions of Shiny prior to 0.11, these Bootstrap 2 components
    were included as part of the package. Later versions of Shiny include
    Bootstrap 3, so the Bootstrap 2 components have been moved into this
    package for those uses who rely on features specific to Bootstrap 2.
